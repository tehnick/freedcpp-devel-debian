Description: file sharing program using Direct Connect protocols
 FreeDC++ is a program for UNIX-like systems that uses the Direct Connect and
 Advanced Direct Connect protocols. It is compatible with EiskaltDC++, DC++,
 AirDC++, FlylinkDC++ and other DC clients. FreeDC++ also interoperates with
 all common DC hub software.
 .
 FreeDC++ is based on LinuxDC++ source code, but now it noticeably differs
 from it.
